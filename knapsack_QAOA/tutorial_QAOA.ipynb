    "# The Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)\n",

    "\n",
    "Solving combinatorial optimization problems using quantum computing is one of those promising applications for the near term. But, why are combinatorial optimization problems even important? Well, we care about them because we have useful applications that can be translated into combinatorial optimization problems, in fields such as logistics, finance, and engineering. But having useful applications is not enough, and it is here where the second ingredient comes in, many combinatorial optimization problems are difficult to solve! and finding good solutions (classically) for large instances of them requires an enormous amount of computational resources and time üòÆ‚Äçüí®. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we will be using a quantum algorithm called the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to solve a combinatorial optimization problem. First, we show how to translate combinatorial optimization problems into the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. In the first part of this notebook, we will show how to encode the Knapsack problem as a target Hamiltonian and solve it using QAOA. The second part is given to you as an exercise to repeat the process but for the Maximal independent set (MIS)."

Why does it grow in that way? because for each item we have two options \"1\" if we bring the item and \"0\" otherwise. So 2 options for each item, and we have 5 items then $2*2*2*2*2 = 2^5 = 32$ combinations in our case.

What about a better initialization? a [different cost function](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.04769.pdf)?, [Error mitigation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14427.pdf)? only you will know by trying different options...
