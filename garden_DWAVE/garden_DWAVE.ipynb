    "\n",
    "What we will focus on: \n",
    "- recognizing a real-life discrete optimization problem which is suitable for solving on a quantum annealer,\n",
    "- learning how to state this problem mathematically, \n",
    "- casting this formulation into a D-Wave-compatible QUBO form,\n",
    "- submitting this problem to D-Wave's LeapHybridSolver and analyzing the results.\n",

    "What we will *not* focus on:\n",

    "For this problem, the objective is to find an optimal placement of vegetable plants in a garden, respecting that some plant species have friendly, neutral, or antagonistic relations with other species (see Fig. 1, where -1 = friendly, 0 = neutral and +1 = antagonistic relationship), a technique known as companion planting. For instance, tomato and lettuce have a friendly relationship and could be placed next to each other, whereas tomato and cucumber have an antagonistic relationship and should be placed apart from each other.\n",

Hybrid solvers have a significantly simpler interface than the \"bare\" DWave QPUs. Therefore, a lot of relevant details about how to tune a QPU to deliver optimal results for your QUBO have been omitted here. \n",

In it you will learn about embedding QUBO problems onto the QPU and tuning parameters such as the chain strength and the annealing time. Knowing how to tune these will ensure that you get the best results out of the quantum annealer! The notebook uses the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP) as a guide, but many of the tuning strategies discussed there are just as well applicable to other QUBO problems.*\n",

Solving this problem allows you to fit as many packages as possible into a single delivery truck, which could save you lots of money if you happen to own Amazon Inc., for example.
