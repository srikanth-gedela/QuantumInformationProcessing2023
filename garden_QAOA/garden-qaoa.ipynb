    "The goal of the Garden Optimization Problem (GOP) [[1]](#ref) is to find an optimal placement of `n` plants into `n` garden pots (one plant per pot). Each plant belongs to a particular species, and in fact, some species like to be placed next to each other, while others do not. An optimal placement of the `n` plants is thus a placement that maximizes the number of friendly relationships between neighboring pots.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the following constraints are added to influence the optimal plant placement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"*Fill all pots*\": Each of the `n` pots must be filled with exactly one plant.\n",
    "2. \"*Place all plants*\": All of the `n` plants are placed in the garden.\n",
    "3. \"*Always look on the bright side of life*\": (additional level of complexity) Large plants should not overshadow smaller plants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Workshop participants are welcome to learn more details about GOP and follow all the steps necessary to complete the binary problem formulation as provided in this [Tutorial](https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/qip/springschool2023/-/blob/main/garden_DWAVE/garden_DWAVE.ipynb). \n",
    "For the purpose of this tutorial, we skip this step and already provide the final binary problem formulation in the class `GardenOptimizationProblem` on only concentrate on the actual model setup.\n",
    "When choosing the problem parameters, please keep in mind the limitation on the maximum problem size (number of variables) that can be treated with quantum simulators. To be able to complete the tutorial with your local PC, the number of the variables (= the number of qubits) should not exceed 24.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GOP setup consists of 2 steps: defining the arrangement of the plant pots and selecting the plant species that should find its best location in the pots. For simplicity, let us consider the simplest $2 \\times 2$ arrangement of pots. Taking into account the 4 possible different types of plants that can be chosen to be placed in the pots, our optimization problem has a total of 16 variables."
